/*
    Most letter mapping discussions on the Internet talk only about mapping of the 26 letters and sometimes also the four
    punctuation keys that on the ANSI/Qwerty layout/mapping fall into the central 3√ó10 field of the keyboard.
    Such a restricted mapping has the advantage that it maps to different (physical) keyboard layouts that don't have
    equivalents for all the ANSI keys.

    But once we add the Thumb-E and have non-ANSI keyboards with very different key positions for the remaining punctuation
    characters, we'll often need to provide a full mapping. In particular, this can create a logical positioning of characters
    inside and outside the core set. (For example / and \ when using the classic 3√ó10 core, - and = (with +) when using the
    thumb30 core, or any of the two when we want to put [] in adjacent center columns, where belongs to the flex mapping and
    the other doesn't.

    Here are some useful Unicode characters that you can use in your mappings:

    White space and other keyboard specials: ‚çΩ ‚Üµ ‚Üπ ‚éã ‚áß ‚á™ ‚å´ ‚å¶ üñ∞
    Navigation keys: ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí ‚á§ ‚á• ‚áû ‚áü ‚Üû ‚Ü† ‚á± ‚á≤

    Useful printable characters: ‚Ç¨ $ ¬¢ ¬£ ¬• ¬µ √ó ‚Äì ¬ø ¬° ¬ß % ‚Ä∞

    Some characters are treated specially, see mergeMapping() for details!

    Terminology:
        - Swap means two characters change position in general.
        - Flip means a swap on the same finger.
        - Fling means a swap to the other hand. Many of the Qwerty-derived mappings have exactly one of that!
          E or R or T to the right pinky! (Or another finger in case of mappings like Colemak which have a lot of finger swaps.)
        - No specific term for finger-swaps.

    For some time, I used the name "Thumby" for the "English Top Nine" straw man mapping below.
    But later I separated both terms, using "Top Nine" for variants based on the ASRT NIOH home row,
    and Thumby for selected mappings that combine a good base mapping with a Thumb key: especially Thumby Colemak and Thumby Quipper.
    An exception is The Cozy Keyboard, which is the Thumby variant of Qwerty Flip/Twist/Fling, a name being just too long to add another prefix to it. üòÖ

    Full list of flip/fling layouts with one thumb key letter and hand swap.
    Nine Home Keys:
     - A S D always stay in place
     - NIO always flips to home row on same finger
     - E moves to the thumb key or the right pinky
     - R or T takes the other of (thumb key, right pinky), while the remaining T or R stays on left index home position.

    This yields four different variants, two of which analyzed below as Flip/Twist/Thumb/Fling and finally the Cozy Keyboard.
    The other two are Thumby Quipper variants.

    Outside of Home Keys:
     - always swap KU because of SFBs with N (and H) as well as better U position.
     - in the case of pinky-E, also fling P to the left hand.

    Basically, there are two winning variants out of many sub-variants and those are The Cozy Keyboard and Thumby Quipper,
    with surprisingly similar scores!

    Basically, to beat those scores, one needs to diverge much more from Qwerty.
    Colemak does that with noticeably lower SFBs.
    (But comparing the relative improvement in typing effort vs learning effort, the lower hanging fruit also offer more gain!)

    description: `This mapping started as a straw man experiment to determine what would be the best single key effort score
    achievable under similar conditions as Colemak. 
    (Which in particular means not changing C's position which among the Colemak fixed letters is the worst-placed one.)
    
    The mapping is built by putting the English Top 9 most frequent letters on home keys, which seems very sensible, 
    since the Top 9 in English have sort-of a gap before the top 10 letter. 
    Anyway, the next most frequent letters are D, L, and U, which are placed in second-best positions on the strongest and 
    longest finger upper row.
    This not just yields a great single key metric, but also pleasantly little changes compared to the Qwerty mapping,
    thus nice learnability not just from Qwerty, but also derived layouts, like in particular Norman which it resembles.
    
    However, the price to pay is some very annoying SFBs involving R. 
    Those can be fixed with more letter swaps, yielding many variants, lots of confusion, but no clear winner.
    And the over-focus on English also reduces the scores for German.
    But at least the straw man allows us to see that the actual winning (well-rounded) layouts are not so far away from
    the theoretical optimum! Which is what the experiment was all about! `,

/*  Port of my personal German layout.
    Note that this supposes a mixed German/ANSI shift-pairing with notably `;:` mapped on `,.` and `=` on `0`.
    Other Shift-mappings can vary, as well as the AltGr mappings, although it seems wise to swap Cmd/AltGr keys because
    most of the German AltGr mappings are on the right hand. This way, we can actually move all of them to the right hand
    (maybe with some compatibility alternatives like @ and ‚Ç¨ staying on the left as a second/alternative mapping), and thus
    we'd only need one exclusive AltGr key. (A secondary AltGr could be tap/hold on `+` which is rare enough not to lead to
    confusion. Similarly, a secondary tap/hold Fn on the Esc key. This would be so much better than my overloadings of `√∂y-`
    on the Iris at the moment.)
