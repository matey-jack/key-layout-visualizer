/*
    Most letter mapping discussions on the Internet talk only about mapping of the 26 letters and sometimes also the four
    punctuation keys that on the ANSI/Qwerty layout/mapping fall into the central 3√ó10 field of the keyboard.
    Such a restricted mapping has the advantage that it maps to different (physical) keyboard layouts that don't have
    equivalents for all the ANSI keys.

    But once we add the Thumb-E and have non-ANSI keyboards with very different key positions for the remaining punctuation
    characters, we'll often need to provide a full mapping. In particular, this can create a logical positioning of characters
    inside and outside the core set. (For example / and \ when using the classic 3√ó10 core, - and = (with +) when using the
    thumb30 core, or any of the two when we want to put [] in adjacent center columns, where belongs to the flex mapping and
    the other doesn't.

    Here are some useful Unicode characters that you can use in your mappings:

    White space and other keyboard specials: ‚çΩ ‚Üµ ‚Üπ ‚éã ‚áß ‚á™ ‚å´ ‚å¶ üñ∞
    Navigation keys: ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí ‚á§ ‚á• ‚áû ‚áü ‚Üû ‚Ü† ‚á± ‚á≤

    Useful printable characters: ‚Ç¨ $ ¬¢ ¬£ ¬• ¬µ √ó ‚Äì ¬ø ¬° ¬ß % ‚Ä∞

    Some characters are treated specially, see mergeMapping() for details!

/*  Port of my personal German layout.
    Note that this supposes a mixed German/ANSI shift-pairing with notably `;:` mapped on `,.` and `=` on `0`.
    Other Shift-mappings can vary, as well as the AltGr mappings, although it seems wise to swap Cmd/AltGr keys because
    most of the German AltGr mappings are on the right hand. This way, we can actually move all of them to the right hand
    (maybe with some compatibility alternatives like @ and ‚Ç¨ staying on the left as a second/alternative mapping), and thus
    we'd only need one exclusive AltGr key. (A secondary AltGr could be tap/hold on `+` which is rare enough not to lead to
    confusion. Similarly, a secondary tap/hold Fn on the Esc key. This would be so much better than my overloadings of `√∂y-`
    on the Iris at the moment.)

         The Harmonic port of this layout changes less than Qwerty, because it is already made for a wide home position.
         Changed chars are √ºzj+
         √º sends away + because there is one less physical key on the upper row.
         J and - simply swap places, both keep their finger and direction assignment.
         (Alternatively swap also Q and J to improve the positioning for frequency.)
         Finally, with `Z` I am not completely sure: it's still a bit awkward to think about this "new" left off-home position
         although the symmetric position on the right has always been a character key in ANSI, even a letter in German.
         TODO: align those layouts with modifications made on Thumby. In particular the Q overspill to the home row.
