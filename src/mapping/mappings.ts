/*  Port of my personal German layout.
    Note that this supposes a mixed German/ANSI shift-pairing with notably `;:` mapped on `,.` and `=` on `0`.
    Other Shift-mappings can vary, as well as the AltGr mappings, although it seems wise to swap Cmd/AltGr keys because
    most of the German AltGr mappings are on the right hand. This way, we can actually move all of them to the right hand
    (maybe with some compatibility alternatives like @ and ‚Ç¨ staying on the left as a second/alternative mapping), and thus
    we'd only need one exclusive AltGr key. (A secondary AltGr could be tap/hold on `+` which is rare enough not to lead to
    confusion. Similarly, a secondary tap/hold Fn on the Esc key. This would be so much better than my overloadings of `√∂y-`
    on the Iris at the moment.)

    With the recent experience, I can imagine a "plus" version of this, which also improves G and H positions by swapping
    with (new) B and K. Since the latter are changing anyway, the learning is only half as much.
