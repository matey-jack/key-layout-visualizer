        on the same key.<br/>

            There is always some individual bias in determining how hard or easy each key on the board is to reach from
            the home position, but the differences are mostly in details, so that a resulting evaluation of letter
            frequency times key effort should not differ strongly enough to justify a change to the layout. This is
            especially true for casual layouts which strongly limit the variation in letter placement.

        <p>
            The following legend shows the percentage of key strokes (according to English average letter frequency),
            that fall on each color of letter. I assigned an effort score for each color of letter. By multiplying

        <p>
            Human hands on a keyboard can move fingers independently and usually will move the next finger to its key
            while the current key is being hit. Obviously this doesn't work when both keys are to be typed by the same
            finger or when both keys are to far away from each other.
            The bigram effort scores give extra penalties to key mappings which make this happen for letter pairs that
            occur very often together. Here are the added frequencies of each type of bigram and theirs score.
            Like for single-key effort, the weighted sum is the total Typing Effort Score for bigrams.
        </p>
        <BigramDetailsLegendItem bigramType={BigramType.SameFinger} frequency={freqs[BigramType.SameFinger]}>
            The worst thing to happen is having to use the same finger subsequently on different keys.
            We count this as highest effort.
        </BigramDetailsLegendItem>
        <BigramDetailsLegendItem bigramType={BigramType.AltFinger} frequency={freqs[BigramType.AltFinger]}>
            When the keyboard layout makes it easy to type some keys with another finger, the single finger bottleneck
            can be avoided. (Maybe you noticed yourself typing "er", "cd", or "un" with two different fingers, although
            strict touchtyping rules assign the same finger to both keys.
        </BigramDetailsLegendItem>
        <BigramDetailsLegendItem bigramType={BigramType.SameRow} frequency={freqs[BigramType.SameRow]}>
            Two keys on the same row are so easy and fun to type, that I assign an effort rebate for this case.
        </BigramDetailsLegendItem>
        <BigramDetailsLegendItem bigramType={BigramType.NeighboringRow} frequency={freqs[BigramType.NeighboringRow]}>
            Two keys on neighboring rows are no extra effort.
        </BigramDetailsLegendItem>
        <BigramDetailsLegendItem bigramType={BigramType.OppositeRow} frequency={freqs[BigramType.OppositeRow]}>
            Two keys on opposite rows (upper and lower letter row) are awkward to type in sequence,
            because curling a finger moves the palm up and stretching a finger moves the palm down.
        </BigramDetailsLegendItem>
        <BigramDetailsLegendItem bigramType={BigramType.InvolvesThumb} frequency={freqs[BigramType.InvolvesThumb]}>
            Bigrams where one letter is on a thumb key are not shown, because (most people's) thumbs move
            independently from the other fingers. (And we have at most one letter key per thumb. And the space key on
            the other thumb.)
        </BigramDetailsLegendItem>
        <BigramDetailsLegendItem bigramType={BigramType.OtherHand} frequency={freqs[BigramType.OtherHand]}>
            Bigrams typed with fingers of different hands aren't shown either. They make no trouble.

            The US American keyboard mapping might be the only one that doesn't come with an AltGr layer.
            Even the UK English keyboards have it! This layer basically allows us to type a lot more characters.
            We can use it for characters that are on the traditional keyboards, but we rarely type them.
            And we can add some extra useful characters like Â¢ or â€° or the m-dash â€“ I really use that one a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think that all punctuation characters used in daily writing should be accessible via a direct key or
            Shift, while more rare characters can easily be moved to the AltGr layer. <br/>
