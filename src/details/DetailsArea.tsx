        Some people will probably hit some of those keys with different fingers. Given the many bigram conflicts and
        general awkwardness of the ANSI layout and Qwerty mapping, it might not even be the same finger for every tap
        on the same key.<br/>
        But however it might be, we need some base model for finger assignment to reason about the typing of bigrams,
        so we'll take this as a start.

            There is always some individual bias in determining how hard or easy each key on the board is to reach from
            the home position, but the differences are mostly in details, so that a resulting evaluation of letter
            frequency times key effort should not differ strongly enough to justify a change to the layout. This is
            especially true for casual layouts which strongly limit the variation in letter placement.

        <p>
            Anyway, here are the key effort scores assigned to each color of key.

                Several neighbors of home keys are inconvenient to reach, especially lateral movement of the index

        <p>
            Human hands on a keyboard can move fingers independently and usually will move the next finger to its key
            while the current key is being hit. Obviously this doesn't work when both keys are to be typed by the same
            finger or when both keys are to far away from each other.
            The bigram effort scores give extra penalties to key mappings which make this happen for letter pairs that
            occur very often together. Here is a legend of the scores I used.
        </p>
        <BigramDetailsLegendItem bigramType={BigramType.SameFinger}>
            The worst thing to happen is having to use the same finger subsequently on different keys.
            We count this as highest effort.
        </BigramDetailsLegendItem>
        <BigramDetailsLegendItem bigramType={BigramType.AltFinger}>
            When the keyboard layout makes it easy to type some keys with another finger, the single finger bottleneck
            can be avoided. (Maybe you noticed yourself typing "er", "cd", or "un" with two different fingers, although
            strict touchtyping rules assign the same finger to both keys.
        </BigramDetailsLegendItem>
        <BigramDetailsLegendItem bigramType={BigramType.SameRow}>
            Two keys on the same row are so easy and fun to type, that I assign an effort rebate for this case.
        </BigramDetailsLegendItem>
        <BigramDetailsLegendItem bigramType={BigramType.NeighboringRow}>
            Two keys on neighboring rows are no extra effort.
        </BigramDetailsLegendItem>
        <BigramDetailsLegendItem bigramType={BigramType.OppositeRow}>
            Two keys on opposite rows (upper and lower letter row) are awkward to type in sequence,
            because curling a finger moves the palm up and stretching a finger moves the palm down.
        </BigramDetailsLegendItem>
        <p>
            The visualization doesn't show when two subsequent letters are typed with two different hands,
            or if one is typed by a thumb.
