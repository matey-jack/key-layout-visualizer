.. when googling for "key layout vizualizer". However, the app itself does not show up in the search results. Please look at the source code and also the resulting @docs/index.html to check what can be done to make the app more search engine-friendly. Make a list of recommendations, ranked independently by impact and effort.

Q: I am thinking to combine both items. Is there a way to extract the text from those UI components which have a lot of text and put it in the initial HTML? Because straight pre-rendering will just put one view into the HTML, right? For example just one layout model plus keymap. I think it would be nice to have all the descriptions for all the layout models and keymaps in the original HTML. Because those texts are the most valuable content. SVGs won't help

A: You're right — SVGs don't help with SEO. Your idea is smart: extract all the text descriptions into static HTML that crawlers can index.
Here's my proposal:

Approach: Create a build-time script that extracts all name and description fields from your layout models and mappings, then generates a <noscript> block (or hidden <div>) with all that text. This gives crawlers rich, indexable content without duplicating strings manually.

Implementation options:

Simple: Add a Vite plugin that runs at build time, imports the TS modules, extracts descriptions, and injects them into index.html
Simpler: Create a script that generates a static HTML snippet you include manually

The text would be visible only to crawlers (via <noscript>) or screen readers (via visually-hidden CSS), so it won't affect the UI.

Want me to implement option 1 (automated Vite plugin)?

me: yes
