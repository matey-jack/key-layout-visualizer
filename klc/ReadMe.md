Those are Windows Keyboard Layout Creator files that have been exported from the app.
I just keep the copies here as backup, maybe they can serve later for a regression diff when the export breaks.

Compiled layouts for Windows are here: https://github.com/matey-jack/wide-ergonomic-keyboard-layouts
