Please remove all automatic tests which specifically test that one layout model has correct array-shape for the matrices thirthyKeyMapping, thumb30KeyMapping, finger assignment, and key effort.
Instead, create a new "layout-models.test.ts" which checks the matrix shape generically for all layouts, similar to src/mapping/mappings.test.ts
Tests should not expect specific row lengths for each layout model (LM).
Just check that all the matrices in each LM have the same size.
Don't fix the layout models that are inconsistent. I will do it later myself.
For reporting the names of LMs in the test, use their .name property.
When names are repeated, add specific .name properties to the LMs which are lacking them.

In the MappingArea, add a checkbox (using components/CheckboxWithLabel.tsx) with label "show all mappings".
By default, this should be switched off, and the mapping list below should only show mappings with the localMaximum flag and Qwerty (standard).
When the flag is on, the list should look exactly as it does now.
But when it's off, don't show color backgrounds in the list, except for the currently selected mapping.

"Keep the signal for this local to the MappingList." (I did that myself, as well as another fix.)

In the ErgoplankLayoutOptions, under "Ergoplank 60", add another checkbox labeled "ANSI angle", disabled by default.
Add a state "ep60ansiAngle: boolean" for this in the LayoutOptions object, with encoding in the URL as "ep60ansi".
Not that getPlankVariant() in layout-selection.ts already uses this.

In the AnsiLayoutOptions, replace the checkbox "use Apple form factor" with a set of three radio buttons:
 - IBM
 - Apple
 - HHKB
 - AHKB

Connect them to the value "ansiVariant" in the LayoutOptions object and remove "ansiApple" from there.
