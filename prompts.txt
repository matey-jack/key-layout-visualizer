Please remove all automatic tests which specifically test that one layout model has correct array-shape for the matrices thirthyKeyMapping, thumb30KeyMapping, finger assignment, and key effort.
Instead, create a new "layout-models.test.ts" which checks the matrix shape generically for all layouts, similar to src/mapping/mappings.test.ts
Tests should not expect specific row lengths for each layout model (LM).
Just check that all the matrices in each LM have the same size.
Don't fix the layout models that are inconsistent. I will do it later myself.
For reporting the names of LMs in the test, use their .name property.
When names are repeated, add specific .name properties to the LMs which are lacking them.
