## Testing

### Unit Tests (Vitest)
You currently can't run vitest via npm. You'll have to ask me to run the tests. 
You can tell me a full "npm test ..." command with parameters and I'll paste back the results.

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
Similarly, you can't run Playwright directly. You can request:
- `npm run e2e` - Run all Playwright tests
- `npm run e2e:ui` - Run tests with UI mode for debugging

The tests are in the `e2e/` directory. Ask me to run them and I'll provide the results.
