# Casual Keyboard Layout and Mapping Visualizer

This visualizes and compares several "casual" (that is easy-to-learn instead of fully optimized) keyboard mappings on different layouts of keyboards.

Key mappings are shown for three different layout types:
 1. the ancient typewriter-based keyboard layout (used in virtually every laptop that was ever made) with its irregular row-staggering, 
2. an orthogonal layout (which for key mapping purposes also stands in for most column-staggered layouts), and 
3. (as a novelty) the Harmonic Keyboard layout which features a regular row-stagger, uniform key sizes, and some other modern details like a split space bar, wide home position, and more options for tying with one's thumbs. 

While only "60% keyboards" are shown, all the letter mappings and many other concepts here also apply to bigger keyboards, with or without numpad or F-keys or nav keys.


# Terminology and Background 

Layout = physical shape, size, and position of keys.

Mapping = assigning keys to functions such as what character to insert.

Note that this differs from most of the world's terminology when the Mapping is instead called "layout" and there is no nice and clear term for the actual layout of hardware keyboards. 
(Historic note: this is probably because the whole world copied the US ANSI keyboard shape and just changed the mapping of characters. 
This went on for many decades until more ergonomically shaped keyboards started to gain traction. I say, "gain traction," because some ergonomic keyboards such as the Kinesis and Maltron are also ancient by modern standards. Note that my definition of "ancient" is "before most of us were born.")

Most keyboard mapping comparisons today focus on thoroughly optimized mappings of letters which have no resemblance to the ancient qwerty mapping found on most commercial keyboards and known by most humans today.
Despite existing for decades and providing many benefits in terms of typing speed and comfort, adaption of such layouts has been low.

Therefore, this app focuses on optimized key mappings that preserve ancient muscle memory by making just a few changes to the qwerty mapping. We aim to get 80% of typing comfort benefits for less than 20% of the learning effort. (And while typing speed may also improve, this is not the main goal.)
Since typing comfort and ergonomics are prioritized over raw speed and anyone can switch to such a layout (and back, when faced with an ancient-type keyboard), we call them "casual" keyboard mappings.
A casual typist is one who uses the keyboard regularly (and might want to relieve or prevent repetitive strain injury and other pains), but who is not fanatic about optimizing their typing or training for speed "like a pro."
