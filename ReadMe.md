# Keyboard Layout and Mapping Visualizer

Layout = physical shape, size, and position of keys

Mapping = assigning keys to functions such as what character to insert

Note that this differs from most of the world's terminology when the Mapping is instead called "layout" and there is no nice and clear term for the actual layout of hardware keyboards. 
(Historic note: this is probably because the whole world copied the US ANSI keyboard shape and just changed the mapping of characters. 
This went on for many decades until more ergonomically shaped keyboards started to gain traction. I say, "gain traction," because some ergonomic keyboards such as the Kinesis and Maltron are also ancient by modern standards. Note that my definition of "ancient" is "before most of us were born.")

While most keyboard mapping comparisons focus on thoroughly optimized mappings of letters which have no resemblance to the ancient qwerty mapping found on most commercial keyboards and known by most humans today, this app focuses on mappings that preserve ancient muscle memory by making just a few changes to qwerty to get 80% of typing comfort benefits for less than 20% of the learning effort. 
Since typing comfort and ergonomics are prioritized over raw speed, and anyone can switch to such a layout (and back, when faced with an ancient-type keyboard), we call them "casual" keyboard mappings.
